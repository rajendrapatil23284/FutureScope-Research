<h1>Microphysiological System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Microphysiological Systems (MPS) are in vitro models composed of cells, tissue explants, or stem-cell derived &#39;organoid&#39; formations of human or animal origin. These models provide translational biochemical, electrical, and/or physiomechanical responses to represent organ and tissue function, with great potential to replace some animals used in research. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), MPS model "functional features of a specific tissue or organ of human or animal origin by exposing cells to a microenvironment that mimics the physiological aspects important for their function or pathophysiological condition." These systems are being developed to better mimic some aspects of specific organ systems or combinations of organ systems to improve upon standard two-dimensional (2D) cell systems, with the goal of eventually replacing animal models being used for hazard identification, risk assessment, and disease modeling, among other uses.</p>
