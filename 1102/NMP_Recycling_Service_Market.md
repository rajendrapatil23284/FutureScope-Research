<h1>NMP Recycling Service Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is an aprotic solvent with the characteristics of high polarity, high boiling point, low viscosity, low volatility, high thermal stability and chemical stability. As a high-performance solvent, it is widely used in lithium-ion battery production, chemical industry and many other fields. Sources of NMP can be divided into two categories: synthetic NMP and recycled NMP. Synthetic NMP refers to NMP products obtained by chemical synthesis. The industrial production route is to use gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and monomethylamine as raw materials to condense to produce NMP products; recycled NMP refers to the recycling and purification of NMP waste liquid used as solvents. Enable recycling. Characteristics of NMP waste liquid: High-concentration NMP: The NMP content in NMP waste liquid is relatively high, and due to the strong solubility of NMP, the waste liquid may be mixed with a variety of other organic and inorganic substances. Low toxicity but certain irritation: Although NMP itself is less toxic than many other organic solvents, high-concentration contact is still irritating to human skin and eyes. Difficulty in treatment: Due to the high boiling point and good solubility of NMP, it is difficult to treat it by physical methods such as evaporation or natural volatilization alone, and specific recovery and purification technologies are required. Strict environmental protection requirements: Especially in industries such as battery manufacturing, the purity of NMP is extremely high, which means that the purity of NMP recovered after the treatment of NMP waste liquid is also required to be high, otherwise it will affect product quality and environmental safety. There are three modes for recycling NMP. Tolling services mode: Tolling support provides a closed-loop cycle in which the customer&#39;s spent solvents are recycled and returned directly to that customer. The customer hands over the NMP waste liquid to the recycling company for processing. The recycling company uses its own technology and equipment to purify the NMP in the waste liquid and then returns it to the customer. The tolling services mode can effectively reduce the customer&#39;s processing costs and realize the recycling of resources. Purchase and sales mode: The recycling company purchases NMP waste liquid from upstream suppliers and sells it to downstream customers after processing and purification. In this mode, the recycling company assumes the dual roles of waste liquid procurement and product sales, and realizes profits through the difference between buying and selling. Internal circulation mode: NMP users recycle NMP in waste liquid by themselves, forming an internal recycling system. This model is mainly suitable for large enterprises or groups, which have complete recycling and treatment facilities and technologies and can process and recycle NMP in waste liquid by themselves. Mitsubishi provides solvent recovery and purification facilities in Japan and abroad. In particular, a number of NMP solvent recovery and purification facilities have been adopted overseas with the increase in global demand for lithium-ion batteries. Using this equipment, NMP can be recycled and purified directly on site without the need to transport it to a third party for processing.</p>
