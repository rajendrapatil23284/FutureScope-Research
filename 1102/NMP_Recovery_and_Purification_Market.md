<h1>NMP Recovery and Purification Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) is one of the important materials for lithium ion batteries. With the characters of high polarity, low volatility and low toxicity, NMP has the advantages of good chemical stability and thermal stability. In the production process of lithium ion battery, NMP is mainly used to dissolve the anode binder PVDF, active substances and conductive agent, and make them into suspension. This conductive paste will be uniformly coated on the two sides of the aluminum foil by the coating machine, then process with drying, sealing, exhausting air and negative pressure. The exhaust air (mainly NMP) in the drying machine is collected by devices like the spray tower or molecular sieves, then recycled through condenser. The treatment efficiency of of the exhaust gas condensate recycling device is about 80% to 90%. The NMP recycling liquid after condensation is purificated by distillation purification equipment. It will be reused when reaching the requirement of lithium battery productive technique. It will not only reduce the unorganized emission of NMP waste gas, but also imporve the cleaner production level of enterprise and realize the recycling of NMP. All will achieve good economic and environmental benefits.</p>
