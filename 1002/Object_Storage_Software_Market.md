 <p>Object Storage Software is a type of computer data storage that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems, which manage data as a file hierarchy, and block storage, which manage data as blocks within sectors and tracks1. Each object contains the data itself, some metadata (descriptive information about the data), and a unique identifier that can be used to locate and access the object. Object Storage Software is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data, such as media files, web content, email, sensor data, and other types of data that do not fit easily into traditional databases. Object Storage Software is usually offered as a cloud-based service, meaning that objects can be accessed from anywhere via the Internet using APIs or HTTP/HTTPS. Object Storage Software provides benefits such as scalability, durability, searchability, security, data integrity, and reliability.</p>
