<h1>Observation Domain (OSR) Correction Service Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Observation Space Representation (OSR) correction service is an important service type in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) high-precision positioning technology. OSR correction service mainly receives GNSS satellite signals in real time through a reference station network (such as GNSS base station) and calculates the expected observation error of the user&#39;s location. These errors include errors caused by various factors such as satellite orbit error, satellite clock error, ionospheric delay, tropospheric delay, etc. Then, the correction service provider transmits these expected observation error information to the user wirelessly, and the user uses this error information to perform positioning calculations to improve positioning accuracy. OSR correction service is widely used in fields that require high-precision positioning, such as surveying, engineering, agriculture, drones, autonomous driving, etc. In these fields, high-precision positioning is crucial to ensure the quality of operations, improve production efficiency and ensure safety. For example, in the agricultural field, OSR correction service can help farmers achieve precise planting, fertilization and irrigation operations; in the field of autonomous driving, OSR correction service can provide accurate location information for autonomous driving vehicles to ensure safe and stable driving of vehicles on the road.</p>
