 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>MABR(Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor) Technology is a wastewater treatment technology that uses oxygen-permeable membranes to create an oxygen-rich environment in a biofilm. The biofilm consists of colonies of microorganisms that break down and remove contaminants from the wastewater. MABR is a relatively new technology that offers several advantages over traditional wastewater treatment methods, including lower energy consumption, reduced need for chemicals and decreased footprint. MABR is particularly effective in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, making it ideal for treating municipal and industrial wastewater.</p>
