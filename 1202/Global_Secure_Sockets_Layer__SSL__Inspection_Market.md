 <p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Inspection, also known as SSL/TLS interception or deep packet inspection (DPI), is a security process used to monitor and analyze encrypted network traffic. SSL inspection involves decrypting SSL/TLS-encrypted communications between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server, inspecting the content for potential threats such as malware, unauthorized data transfers, or policy violations, and then re-encrypting the traffic before forwarding it to its destination.</p>
